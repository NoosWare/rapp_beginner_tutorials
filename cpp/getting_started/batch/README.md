# Cloud Batches
-------------

* *This tutorial assumes that RAPP API is installed and built*
* *This tutorial uses the 0.7.0 version* of the C++ API

In the following example we are going to execute three actions at the same time:

* face detection
* human detection
* door angle detection

Include the following headers:

* service_controller.hpp
* picture.hpp
* vision_detection.hpp
* iostream

Then create a service controller as in the previous examples:

```cpp
rapp::cloud::platform info = {"rapp.ee.auth.gr", "9001", "rapp_token"}; 
rapp::cloud::service_controller ctrl(info);
```

In this example we are going to use vision detection, so we a picture.
We will try to detect faces, humans and doors in the same picture.
If loading a picture from disk, then constuct a `rapp::object::picture` object (replace *my_picture.jpg* with a valid one!).

__NOTE:__ only *PNG* and *JPEG* are formats supported currently.

```cpp
auto pic = rapp::object::picture("my_picture.jpg");
```

Each cloud call takes a different callback functor, so we'll create one for each call.
You can find more information for each class in `rapp/cloud/vision_detection.hpp`

* face detection:

```cpp
auto face_cb = [&](std::vector<rapp::object::face> faces) { 
    std::cout << "Found " << faces.size() << " faces!" << std::endl;
};
```

* human detection:

```cpp
auto human_cb = [&](std::vector<rapp::object::human> humans) {
    std::cout << "Found " << humans.size() << " humans!" << std::endl;
};
```

* door angle:

```cpp
auto hazard_cb = [&](double door_angle) {
    std::cout << "Door angle: " << door_angle  << std::endl;
};
```

When we run the batch, we construct the cloud call in inline object as we execute `service_controller::make_calls`:

```cpp
ctrl.make_calls(rapp::cloud::face_detection(pic, false, face_cb),
                rapp::cloud::human_detection(pic, human_cb),
                rapp::cloud::door_angle_detection(pic, hazard_cb));
```

When the platform responds, we'll receive:

```
Door angle: 2
Found 2 humans!
Found 1 faces!
```

The order of the calls may change: there is a possibility that face detection may finish first
and then human detection.
